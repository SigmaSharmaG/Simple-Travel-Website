# Simple Travel Website  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **basic travel website** built using **HTML5**. It is designed to showcase travel destinations, essential travel information, and related resources. The website provides a simple and clean structure for users to explore top destinations, travel packages, and essential items to carry.  

The project is created as part of a **Web Development assignment** to demonstrate the use of:  
- HTML structural tags (`header`, `main`, `footer`)  
- Text formatting (`strong`, `em`, `u`, `s`)  
- Lists (`ol`, `ul`, `dl`)  
- Tables for package details  
- Links, images, and semantic elements

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** (structure and semantic tags)  
- **No CSS/JS** (as this is a pure HTML assignment)
